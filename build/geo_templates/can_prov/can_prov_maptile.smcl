{synoptset 22 tabbed}{...}
{synopt:{bf:mapifprov}}excludes the territories from the map, only mapping the 10 provinces{p_end}

{p 32 32 2}This does not exclude the territories' data from the calculation of the quantiles (equal-sized color bins). To avoid counting the territories in the quantiles, add an {bf:if} statement to your maptile command that excludes them.{p_end}

{p 32 32 2}{opt mapifprov} is equivalent to {opt mapif( <province, not territory> )} but additionally adjusts the legend placement.{p_end}

{synoptset 22 tabbed}{...}
{synopt:{opt legendoffset(#)}}manually shifts the legend downward. # must be non-negative. When not specified, the legend offset is computed automatically.{p_end}
